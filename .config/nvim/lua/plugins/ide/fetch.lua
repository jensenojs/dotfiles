-- im-fetch enables Vim to process line and column jump specifications in file paths as found in stack traces and similar output. When asked to open such a file, in- or outside Vim or via gF, Vim with vim-fetch will jump to the specified line (and column, if given) instead of displaying an empty, new file.
